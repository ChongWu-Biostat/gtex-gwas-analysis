# Counting significant associations

The following is included for documentation reasons.
`count_hits.sh` is a PBS queue array job that will gather summary statistics (one trait per job) of significant results.
`count_hits.R` is the actual script being run in the above.
`count_hits_plots.R` picks up the output of the above and performs some plotting. Most of this code was migrated to a markdown under `/analysis` folder in this workflowr repository.
